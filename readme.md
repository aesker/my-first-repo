## Geography

I live in the city of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, in Canada. 

### Reading

I don't really have a favourite book, but I have a few I appreciate deeply:

- *Stranger In A Strange Land* by Robert M. Heinlein
- *Symptom of the Universe* by Mick Wall
- *Where Others Won't* by Cody Royle

These are a few of the books I've read in the last month.

### Music

I am a big fan of Heavy Metal, and every once in a while I fall back into the music that I love. 

Here are a few of my favourite bands:

1. Black Sabbath
2. Judas Priest
3. Ozzy Osbourne

One of my favourite songs at the moment is "I" by Black Sabbath from the Dehumanizer album, which featured Ronnie James Dio on vocals.

Here's a link to a really great version of the song! !(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHHOwxlESK8)

I am also a big fan of football, and Arsenal is the club of my heart.
